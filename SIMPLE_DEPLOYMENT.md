# Atlas Document Management - Simple Vercel Deployment

## The Fix
I removed the vercel.json file completely. Vercel will now auto-detect your Node.js + React application and handle the build process automatically.

## Step-by-Step Deployment

### 1. Remove vercel.json from GitHub
- Go to your GitHub repository
- Delete the vercel.json file (if it exists)
- Commit the deletion

### 2. Set up Neon Database (Free PostgreSQL)
1. Go to [neon.tech](https://neon.tech)
2. Sign up and create a new project: "atlas-documents"  
3. Copy the connection string from your dashboard

### 3. Deploy to Vercel
1. Go to [vercel.com](https://vercel.com) and sign up
2. Click "Import Project" â†’ Connect your GitHub repo
3. Vercel will auto-detect it as a Node.js project
4. Before deploying, add environment variables:
   - `DATABASE_URL` = Your Neon connection string
   - `SESSION_SECRET` = `atlas-secret-2025`
5. Click "Deploy"

### 4. What Vercel Will Do Automatically
- Detect Node.js backend from package.json
- Build your React frontend with `npm run build`
- Serve API routes from `/server/index.ts`
- Serve static files from `/client/dist/`

### 5. After Deployment
1. Visit your live app URL
2. Login and upload your Excel files:
   - Document Submittal Log-RAQ.xlsx
   - Shop Drawing Log-RAQ.xlsx
3. All 490 documents and drawings will be processed

## Why This Works
- No configuration conflicts
- Vercel handles everything automatically
- Your app structure is already perfect for Vercel
- All Excel processing functionality preserved

Your Atlas Document Management System will be live at: `https://your-app-name.vercel.app`
