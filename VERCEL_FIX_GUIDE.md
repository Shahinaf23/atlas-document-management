# Fix 404 Error on Vercel - Atlas Document Management

## The Problem
Your app deployed successfully but shows 404 because:
1. Vercel wasn't building your React frontend (only the Node.js backend)
2. The routing configuration wasn't pointing to the correct built files

## The Solution
I've created the correct configuration:

### Files Created:
- **vercel.json**: Proper build and routing configuration
- **build-for-vercel.js**: Custom build script that builds both frontend and backend

## How to Fix Your Live App

### Step 1: Push Updated Configuration
```bash
# Add the new files to your repository
git add vercel.json build-for-vercel.js VERCEL_FIX_GUIDE.md

# Commit the fix
git commit -m "Fix 404 error - add proper Vercel build configuration"

# Push to GitHub
git push origin main
```

### Step 2: Redeploy on Vercel
1. Go to your Vercel dashboard: [vercel.com/dashboard](https://vercel.com/dashboard)
2. Find your "atlas-document" project
3. Click **"Redeploy"** on the latest deployment
4. Or push any change to trigger auto-deployment

### Step 3: What Will Happen Now
The new build process will:
1. **Build React frontend** → Creates `client/dist/index.html`
2. **Build Node.js backend** → Creates `dist/index.js`
3. **Route API calls** to `/api/*` → Node.js backend
4. **Route all other requests** to React frontend

## Expected Result
- ✅ **https://atlas-document-a95k.vercel.app/** → Shows your login page
- ✅ **https://atlas-document-a95k.vercel.app/api/status** → Shows API response
- ✅ **https://atlas-document-a95k.vercel.app/dashboard** → Shows dashboard (after login)

## Testing Your Fixed App
1. Visit your Vercel URL
2. You should see the Atlas login page (not 404)
3. Login and upload your Excel files
4. All 490 documents and drawings will work correctly

## Why This Works
- **Custom build script**: Builds both React and Node.js properly
- **Correct routing**: API calls go to backend, everything else to frontend
- **Static file serving**: React router handles client-side navigation

Your Atlas Document Management System will be fully functional after redeployment!
