# Quick Fix for Vercel 404 Error

## The Problem
Your Atlas app shows 404 because Vercel isn't correctly building and serving your React frontend.

## Simple Solution

### Step 1: Use a Different Approach
Since your app has both frontend and backend in one repo, let's deploy them separately:

**Frontend (React) → Vercel**
**Backend (Node.js) → Railway or Render**

### Step 2: Quick Frontend-Only Deployment

I've updated vercel.json to deploy only your React frontend:

```json
{
  "buildCommand": "npm run build", 
  "outputDirectory": "client/dist",
  "framework": "vite"
}
```

### Step 3: Deploy Steps
1. **Push to GitHub**:
   ```bash
   git add vercel.json QUICK_FIX.md
   git commit -m "Fix Vercel deployment - frontend only"
   git push origin main
   ```

2. **Redeploy on Vercel**
   - Go to your Vercel dashboard
   - Click "Redeploy" on your project
   
3. **Result**: Your React app will load, but you'll need a separate backend

## Alternative: All-in-One Solution

### Option A: Deploy to Railway (Recommended)
- Railway handles full-stack apps better
- Free tier: $5 credits (lasts months)
- One-click deployment with database

### Option B: Use Render (Free)
- Deploy full-stack app together
- Free PostgreSQL database
- 15-minute sleep (acceptable for most users)

### Option C: Netlify + Serverless Functions
- Frontend on Netlify
- API as serverless functions
- Both completely free

## Recommendation
For your Atlas Document Management System with Excel processing, **Railway** is the best choice because it handles file uploads and complex backend operations better than Vercel's serverless functions.
